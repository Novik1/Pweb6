# Lab 6 - Securing web applications

## Story

Imagine, you're a security expert at HackyBits Ltda, Sao Paolo. Your domain of expertise is web applications. One day, a client sends to your e-mail a link to their project, and you check it out. You start by downloading the files and launching the project. Your next task is to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and to find right solutions for them.

## Task

1. Copy the contents of [app](app) directory to your repo;
2. Identify as many as possible security vulnerabilities in the code;
3. Describe with your own words each vulnerability -- how you discovered the vulnerability, how to reproduce it, what's the impact on the business or on the users;
4. Suggest code improvements.

## Special conditions

No restrictions.

## Grading

For each vulnerability found, you can get:
  - `+1.5` points for its description & steps to reproduce;
  - `+0.5` points for its impact on business or on the users;
  - `+2` points for solutions how to fix the vulnerability.

## Hints

- You can use Developer tools for inspecting loaded resources - HTML, CSS, JS;
- You can use tools like Wireshark to see what data is sent over the wire.
